                        Graphics is defined as any sketch or a drawing or a special network that pictorially represents some meaningful information. Computer graphics deals with generating images with the aid of computers. The phrase was coined in 1960 by computer graphics researchers
                        Verne Hudson and William Fetter of Boeing. It is the vast subject and area in the field of computer science. Computer graphics is used in UI design, computer animation, vector graphics, 3D modeling,GPU design, visualization, image
                        processing, computational photography, scientific visualization, computational geometry, computer vision, etc. In most area the computer graphics in an abbreviation of CG. There are several tools used in the implementation of computer
                        graphics. The basic is the
                        <graphics.h> header file in Turbo-C, Unity for advanced and even OpenGL can be used for it's implementation.<br><br> Computer graphics refers to several different things:<br> - the representation and manipulation of image data by computer.<br>                            - the various technologies used to create and manipulate images.<br> - methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content.<br><br> Types of Computer Graphics -<br> 1. Raster Graphics<br> 2. Vector Graphics<br><br>                            1. Raster Graphics- In Raster Graphics, Raster images use bitmaps to store information. This means a large file needs a large bitmap. The larger the image, the more disk space the image will take up. As an example, a 640x480
                            image requires information to be stored for 307,200 pixels, while a 3072x2048 image needs to store information for 6,291,456 pixels. We use algorithms which compress images to help reduce these file sizes. Image formats like
                            jpeg and gif are comman compressed image formats. Scaling down these images is easy but enlarging a bitmap makes is pixelated or simply blurred. Hence, for images which need to be scaled to different sizes, we use vector graphics.
                            File extenstions- .jpeg, .gif, .tif, .bmp, etc.<br><br> Applications of Raster Graphics:<br><br> 1. Computer Displays- Most modern computers have bitmapped displays, where each on-screen pixel directly corresponds to a small
                            number of bits in the memory. The screen is simply refreshed by scanning pixels according to each set of bits.<br> 2. Image Storage- Most computer images are stored in raster graphics format, including gif, jpeg, and png, which
                            are popular on the World Wide Web.<br> 3. Geographic information systems- GIS data is commanly stored in a raster format to encode geographic data as the pixel values.<br><br> 2. Vector Graphics- Making use of sequential commands
                            or mathematical statements or programs which place lines or shapes in 2D or 3D environment is reffered to as Vector Graphics. Vector graphics are best for printing since it is composed of a series of mathematical curves. As
                            a result, vector graphics print crisply even when they are enlarged. In physics: A vector is something which has a magnitude and direction. In vector graphics the file is created and saved as a sequence of vector statements.
                            Rather than having a bit in a file for each bit of line drawing we use commands which describe series of points to be connected. As a result a much smaller file is obtained. File extenstions- .svg, .eps, .pdf, .ai, .dxf, etc<br><br>                            Applications of Vector Graphics:<br> 1.

                <label class="drop" for="2018_Q1b">1 (b). Define display devices. Discuss its type in detail.</label>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>
                        The display device is an output device used to represent the information in the form of images.Display systems are mostly called a video monitor or Video display unit (VDU). Display devices are designed to model, view, or display information. The purpose
                        of display technology is to simplify information sharing. Today, the demand for high-quality displays is increasing.<br><br> These are some display devices given below:<br><br> 1. Cathode-Ray Tube(CRT)<br>                        2. Color CRT Monitor<br> 3. Liquid crystal display(LCD)<br> 4. Light Emitting Diode(LED)<br> 5. Direct View Storage Tubes(DVST)<br> 6. Plasma Display<br> 7. 3D Display<br><br> 1. Cathode-ray Tube (CRT): A cathode ray tube (CRT)
                        is a specialized vacuum tube in which images are produced when an electron beam strikes a phosphorescent surface.It modulates, accelerates, and deflects electron beam(s) onto the screen to create the images. Most desktop computer
                        displays make use of CRT for image displaying purposes. .<br><br> Construction of a CRT – <br><br> 1. The primary components are the heated metal cathode and a control grid.<br><br> 2. The heat is supplied to the cathode (by passing
                        current through the filament). This way the electrons get heated up and start getting ejected out of the cathode filament.<br><br> 3. This stream of negatively charged electrons is accelerated towards the phosphor screen by supplying
                        a high positive voltage.<br><br> 4. This acceleration is generally produced by means of an accelerating anode.<br><br> 5. Next component is the Focusing System, which is used to force the electron beam to converge to small spot
                        on the screen. <br><br> 6. If there will not be any focusing system, the electrons will be scattered because of their own repulsions and hence we won’t get a sharp image of the object. <br><br> 7. This focusing can be either by
                        means of electrostatic fields or magnetic fields. <br><br> There are two ways to display an object on the screen: <br><br> 1. Raster Scan Display<br> 2. Random Scan Display<br><br> 1. Raster Scan Display- Raster Scan Displays are
                        most common type of graphics monitor which employs CRT. It is based on television technology. In raster scan system electron beam sweeps across the screen, from top to bottom covering one row at a time.A pattern of illuminated
                        pattern of spots is created by turning beam intensity on and off as it moves across each row. A memory area called refresh buffer or frame buffer stores picture definition. This memory area holds intensity values for all screen
                        points. Stored intensity values are restored from frame buffer and painted on screen taking one row at a time.Each screen point is referred to as pixels. In raster scan systems refreshing is done at done at a rate of 60-80 frames
                        per second. <br><br> ADVANTAGES: <br><br> 1. Real life images with different shades can be displayed. <br> 2. Color range available is bigger than random scan display. <br><br> DISADVANTAGES: <br><br> 1. Resolution is lower than
                        random scan display. <br> 2. More memory is required. <br> 3. Data about the intensities of all pixel has to be stored. <br><br> 2. Random Scan Display- In Random-Scan Display electron beam is directed only to the ares of screen
                        where a picture has to be drawn. It is also called vector displays, as it draws picture one line at time. It can draw and refresh component lines of a picture in any specified sequence. Pen plotter is an example of random-scan
                        displays. The number of lines regulates refresh rate on random-scan displays. An area of memory called refresh display files stores picture definition as a set of line drawing commands. <br><br> ADVANTAGES: <br><br> 1. Higher resolution
                        as compared to raster scan display. <br> 2. Produces smooth line drawing. <br> 3. Less Memory required. <br><br> DISADVANTAGES: <br><br> 1. Realistic images with different shades cannot be drawn. <br> 2. Color limitations. <br><br>                        2. Color CRT Monitor: It is similar to a CRT monitor. The basic idea behind the color CRT monitor is to combine three basic colors- Red, Green, and Blue. By using these three colors, we can produce millions of different colors.
                        <br><br> The two basic color display producing techniques are: <br><br> 1. Beam–Penetration Method: It is used with a random scan monitor for displaying pictures. There are two phosphorus layers- Red and Green are coated inside
                        the screen. The color shown depends on how far the electron beam penetrates the phosphorus surface. <br><br> 2. Shadow–Mask Method: It is used with a raster scan monitor for displaying pictures. It has more range of color than
                        the beam penetration method. It is used in television sets and monitors. <br><br> 3. Liquid crystal display (LCD): The LCD depends upon the light modulating properties of liquid crystals. LCD is used in watches and portable computers.
                        LCD requires an AC power supply instead of DC, so it is difficult to use it in circuits. It generally works on flat panel display technology. LCD consumes less power than LED. The LCD screen uses the liquid crystal to turn pixels
                        on or off. Liquid Crystals are a mixture of solid and liquid. When the current flows inside it, its position changes into the desired color. <br><br> ADVANTAGES: <br><br> 1. Produce a bright image. <br> 2. Energy efficient. <br>                        3. Completely flat screen. <br><br> DISADVANTAGES: <br><br> 1. Fixed aspect ratio & Resolution. <br> 2. Lower Contrast. <br> 3. More Expensive. <br><br> 4. Light Emitting Diode (LED): LED is a device which emits when current passes
                        through it. It is a semiconductor device. The size of the LED is small, so we can easily make any display unit by arranging a large number of LEDs. LED consumes more power compared to LCD. LED is used on TV, smartphones, motor
                        vehicles, traffic light, etc. LEDs are powerful in structure, so they are capable of withstanding mechanical pressure. LED also works at high temperatures. <br><br> ADVANTAGES: <br><br> 1. The Intensity of light can be controlled.
                        <br> 2. Low operational Voltage. <br> 3. Capable of handling the high temperature. <br><br> DISADVANTAGES: <br><br> 1. More Power Consuming than LCD. <br>

                    The Aspect ratio of picture is the ratio of its width to its height. It is normally shown by two numbers separated by colon, as in 4:3. Here, the primary number tells that the picture is 4 units wide and the subsequent number tells that the picture is 3 units high. The most commonly utilized aspect ratios are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1 for film photography, 3:2 in still camera photography and 4:3 and 16:9 on TV.
                    The most well-known aspect ratios utilized today in introduction of movies in theaters are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1. Two regular TV aspect ratios are 4:3 (1.3:1), all-inclusive video configuration of twentieth century, and 16:9 (1.7:1), general for top quality TV and European advanced TV. Other films and video angle ratios additionally exist, however are utilized rarely. In still camera photography, most well-known aspect ratios are 4:3, 3:2, and all more as of late found in purchaser cameras, 16:9. Other perspective proportions, for example, 5:3, 5:4, and 1:1 (square configuration) are utilized in photography too, especially in medium arrangement and huge organization.
                    Changing over various ratios into another is made achievable by extending first picture to fill getting ratio’s showcase territory and removing any abundance picture data (zooming and editing), by including even mattes or vertical mattes to hold first organization’s aspect ratio, by extending (twisting) picture to fill accepting configuration’s ratio, or by scaling by various elements in two bearings.

                    16:9 Standard –<br>
                    16:9 (1.7:1) is universal standard configuration of HDTV, non-HD computerized TV, and simple widescreen TV. Numerous advanced camcorders have capacity to record in 16:9 (= 42:32), and 16:9 is main widescreen aspect ratio locally upheld by DVD standard. DVD makers can likewise decide to show significantly more extensive proportions.<br>

                    Bresenham's line drawing algorithm is used for scan converting a line. It was developed by Jack Elton Bresenham in 1962. It is an efficient method because it involves only integer addition, subtractions, and multiplication operations. These operations can be performed very rapidly so lines can be generated quickly.
                    <br><br>
                    In this method, next pixel selected is that one who has the least distance from true line.
                    <br><br>
                    Bresenham's Line Algorithm:
                    <br><br>
                    Step1: Read two end points p1(x1, y1) and P2(x2, y2).<br>
                    Step2: Calculate<br>
                            dx = x2-x1<br>
                                    dy = y2-y1<br>
                                    
                    Step3: Calculate decision parameter P<br>
                            P = 2dy - dx<br>
                    Step4: Set initial point<br>
                            x=x1<br>
                            y=y1<br>
                            and i=0<br>
                    Step5: Now, Plot the point (x, y)<br>
                            if P<0 then<br>
                                x=x+1<br>

                    Step6: Repeat Step5 until i<=dx<br>
                    Step7: Stop<br><br>
                    Advantage:<br>
                    1. It involves only integer arithmetic, so it is simple.<br>
                    <br>
                    2. It avoids the generation of duplicate points.
                    <br>
                    3. It can be implemented using hardware because it does not use multiplication and division.
                    <br>
                    4. It is faster as compared to DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) because it does not involve floating point calculations like DDA Algorithm.
                    <br><br>
                    Disadvantage:<br>
                    1. This algorithm is meant for basic line drawing only Initializing is not a part of Bresenham's line algorithm. So to draw smooth lines, you should want to look into a different algorithm.
                    <br>
                    Example:<br>
                    Q. Draw a line with end points (20, 10) and (30, 18) using Bresenham's algorithm.<br><br>

                    Step2: dx=x2-x1=30-20=10<br>
                        dy=y2-y2=18-10=8<br>

                    Transformation means changing some graphics into something else by applying rules. We can have various types of transformations such as translation, scaling up or down, rotation, shearing, etc. When a transformation takes place on a 2D plane, it is called 2D transformation.
                    <br><br>
                    Transformations play an important role in computer graphics to reposition the graphics on the screen and change their size or orientation.
                    <br><br>
                    In computer graphics, transformation of the coordinates consists of three major processes:
                    <br><br>
                    1. Translation<br>
                    2. Rotation<br>
                    3. Scaling<br>
                    <br>
                    1. Translation: A translation process moves every point a constant distance in a specified direction. It can be described as a rigid motion. A translation can also be interpreted as the addition of a constant vector to every point, or as shifting the origin of the coordinate system.<br>
                    Suppose, If point (X, Y) is to be translated by amount Dx and Dy to a new location (X’, Y’) then new coordinates can be obtained by adding Dx to X and Dy to Y as:<br>
                    <br>
                    X' = Dx + X<br>
                    Y' = Dy + Y<br>
                    <br>
                    or P' = T + P where<br>
                    <br>
                    P' = (X', Y'),<br>
                    T = (Dx, Dy ),<br>
                    P = (X, Y)<br>
                    <br>
                    Here, P(X, Y) is the original point. T(Dx, Dy) is the translation factor, i.e. the amount by which the point will be translated. P'(X’, Y’) is the coordinates of point P after translation.
                    <br><br>
                    2. Rotation: Rotating an object by a given angle about a given pivot point and print the new co-ordinates is called Rotation.
                    <br><br>
                    3. Scaling: A scaling transformation alters size of an object. In the scaling process, we either compress or expand the dimension of the object.
                    Scaling operation can be achieved by multiplying each vertex coordinate (x, y) of the polygon by scaling factor sx and sy to produce the transformed coordinates as (x’, y’).<br>
                    So, x’ = x * sx and y’ = y * sy.<br>
                    The scaling factor sx, sy scales the object in X and Y direction respectively.

                    Plasma-Panels are also called as Gas-Discharge Display. It consists of an array of small lights. Lights are fluorescent in nature. The essential components of the plasma-panel display are:
                    <br><br>
                    Cathode: It consists of fine wires. It delivers negative voltage to gas cells. The voltage is released along with the negative axis.<br>
                    Anode: It also consists of line wires. It delivers positive voltage. The voltage is supplied along positive axis.<br>
                    Fluorescent cells: It consists of small pockets of gas liquids when the voltage is applied to this liquid (neon gas) it emits light.<br>
                    Glass Plates: These plates act as capacitors. The voltage will be applied, the cell will glow continuously.
                    The gas will slow when there is a significant voltage difference between horizontal and vertical wires. The voltage level is kept between 90 volts to 120 volts. Plasma level does not require refreshing. Erasing is done by reducing the voltage to 90 volts.<br>
                    <br>
                    Each cell of plasma has two states, so cell is said to be stable. Displayable point in plasma panel is made by the crossing of the horizontal and vertical grid. The resolution of the plasma panel can be up to 512 * 512 pixels.

                    (b) Raster Scan Displays are most common type of graphics monitor which employs CRT. It is based on television technology. In raster scan system electron beam sweeps across the screen, from top to bottom covering one row at a time.A pattern of illuminated pattern of spots is created by turning beam intensity on and off as it moves across each row. A memory area called refresh buffer or frame buffer stores picture definition. This memory area holds intensity values for all screen points. Stored intensity values are restored from frame buffer and painted on screen taking one row at a time.Each screen point is referred to as pixels.

                    In raster scan systems refreshing is done at done at a rate of 60-80 frames per second. Refresh rates are also sometimes described in units of cycles per second / Hertz (Hz). At the end of each scan line, electron beam begins to display next scan line after returning to left side of screen. The return to the left of screen after refresh of each scan line is known as horizontal retrace of electron beam. At the end of each frame electron beam returns to top left corner and begins the next frame.

                    (c) Cathode Ray Tubes (CRT) – <br>
                    A cathode ray tube (CRT) is a specialized vacuum tube in which images are produced when an electron beam strikes a phosphorescent surface.It modulates, accelerates, and deflects electron beam(s) onto the screen to create the images. Most desktop computer displays make use of CRT for image displaying purposes.

                    <br>
                    Electrostatic Deflection – <br>
                    The electron beam (cathode rays) passes through a highly positively charged metal cylinder that forms an electrostatic lens. This electrostatic lens focuses the cathode rays to the center of the screen in the same way as an optical lens focuses the beam of light. Two pairs of parallel plates are mounted inside the CRT tube. Electrostatic deflection sensitivity of a Cathode Ray Tube is the amount of deflection produced in the electron beam when a voltage of 1V is applied between the plates.<br>
                    Magnetic Deflection – <br>
                    Here, two pairs of coils are used. One pair is mounted on the top and bottom of the CRT tube, and the other pair on the two opposite sides. The magnetic field produced by both these pairs is such that a force is generated on the electron beam in a direction which is perpendicular to both the direction of the magnetic field and to the direction of flow of the beam. One pair is mounted horizontally and the other vertically.<br>
                    Now as this highly energetic beam strikes the surface of the screen, these electrons are stopped and their kinetic energy is absorbed by the phosphor screen (atoms). Some energy is wasted in heat also, but the majority of the kinetic energy gets transferred to the phosphor atoms. As these atoms receive this huge amount of energy, they get excited to a higher energy level. <br>
                    <br>
                    After a short time, these atoms start returning to their original energy level. The original level is at a lower energy level than the excited one, hence the atoms release some energy while coming down. This extra energy is dissipated in the form of a small quantum of light. Thus the de-excitation results in a bright-colored spot on the screen. The frequency (color) of the spot depends on the difference between the two energy levels (excited level and ground-state level). 
                    <br><br>
                    Different kinds of phosphors are used in a CRT. The difference is based upon the time for how long the phosphor continues to emit light after the CRT beam has been removed. This property is referred to as Persistence. Basically, persistence means how much time is taken by the emitted light to reduce to one-tenth of its original intensity. Now, phosphors with lower persistence require higher refresh rates to maintain a picture on the screen without any flicker. 
                    <br><br>
                    (d) Vector Scan Display- In Random-Scan Display electron beam is directed only to the ares of screen where a picture has to be drawn. It is also called vector displays, as it draws picture one line at time. It can draw and refresh component lines of a picture in any specified sequence. Pen plotter is an example of random-scan displays.
                    <br><br>
                    The number of lines regulates refresh rate on random-scan displays. An area of memory called refresh display files stores picture definition as a set of line drawing commands. The system returns back to first line command in the list, after all the drawing commands have been processed. High-quality vector systems can handle around 100, 00 short lines at this refresh rate. Faster refreshing can burn the phosphor. To avoid this every refresh cycle is delayed to prevent refresh rate greater than 60 frames per second.

                    Plasma-Panels are also called as Gas-Discharge Display. It consists of an array of small lights. Lights are fluorescent in nature. The essential components of the plasma-panel display are:
                    <br><br>
                    Cathode: It consists of fine wires. It delivers negative voltage to gas cells. The voltage is released along with the negative axis.<br>
                    Anode: It also consists of line wires. It delivers positive voltage. The voltage is supplied along positive axis.<br>
                    Fluorescent cells: It consists of small pockets of gas liquids when the voltage is applied to this liquid (neon gas) it emits light.<br>
                    Glass Plates: These plates act as capacitors. The voltage will be applied, the cell will glow continuously.
                    The gas will slow when there is a significant voltage difference between horizontal and vertical wires. The voltage level is kept between 90 volts to 120 volts. Plasma level does not require refreshing. Erasing is done by reducing the voltage to 90 volts.<br>
                    <br>
                    Each cell of plasma has two states, so cell is said to be stable. Displayable point in plasma panel is made by the crossing of the horizontal and vertical grid. The resolution of the plasma panel can be up to 512 * 512 pixels.

The return to the left of screen after refresh of each scan line is known as horizontal retrace of electron beam. At the end of each frame electron beam returns to top left corner and begins the next frame.
